# Getting Started with a Smart Contract

[PREVIOUS - Introduction](./00-Introduction.md) <==> [NEXT Adding a Transaction Function](./02-Exercise-Adding-tx-function.md)

---

Make sure you have cloned the workshop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git fabric-samples
cd fabric-samples/full-stack-asset-transfer-guide

export WORKSHOP_PATH=$(pwd)
```

First please check you've got the [required tools](../../SETUP.md) needed for the dev part of this workshop (docker, just, weft, node.js, and Fabric peer binary). To double check run the `check.sh` script

```
${WORKSHOP_PATH}/check.sh
```

Let's dive straight into creating some code to manage an 'asset'; best to have two windows open, one for running the 'FabricNetwork' and one for 'ChaincodeDev'. You may wish to open a third to watch the logs of the running Fabric Network.

## Start the Fabric Infrastructure

We're using MicroFab for the Fabric infrastructure as it's a single container that is fast to start.
The MicroFab container includes an ordering service node and a peer process that is pre-configured to create a channel and call external chaincodes.
It also includes credentials for an `org1` organization, which will be used to run the peer. We'll use an `org1` admin user when interacting with the environment.

We'll use `just` recipes to execute multiple commands. `just` recipes are similar to `make` but simpler to understand. You can open the [justfile](../../justfile) in the project root directory to see which commands are run with each recipe.

Start the MicroFab container by running the `just` recipe. This will set some properties for the MicroFab environment and start the MicroFab docker container.

```bash
just microfab
```

This will start the docker container (automatically download it if necessary), and also write out some configuration/data files in the `_cfg/uf` directory.

```bash
ls -1 _cfg/uf

_cfg
_gateways
_wallets
org1admin.env
org2admin.env
```

A file `org1admin.env` is written out that contains the environment variables needed to run applications _as the org1 admin identity_. A second organization is created, with a `org2admin.env` - this is for later exercises and is not needed at the moment.

Let's take a look at the environment variables and source the file to set the environment variables:

```bash
source _cfg/uf/org1admin.env
cat _cfg/uf/org1admin.env
```

You'll see these environment variables set:

```bash
# sample contents
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org1MSP
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/workshop/full-stack-asset-transfer-guide/_cfg/uf/_msp/org1/org1admin/msp
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=org1peer-api.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8080
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=/workshop/full-stack-asset-transfer-guide/config
export CORE_PEER_CLIENT_CONNTIMEOUT=15s
export CORE_PEER_DELIVERYCLIENT_CONNTIMEOUT=15s
```

Next let's look at the three directories that are created `_msp`, `_gateways`, `_wallets`. If you are short on time you can [skip ahead to the next section to package and deploy a chaincode](#package-and-deploy-chaincode-to-fabric).

Firstly the `_msp` directory contains the membership services provider (MSP) credentials necessary to run the Fabric Peer CLI commands as the org1 admin, including the user's public certificate and private key for signing transactions. The MSP location is referenced in the `CORE_PEER_MSGCONFIGPATH` environment variable and contains the credential subdirectories expected by the Peer CLI command.

Secondly the `_gateways` directory contains two JSON files, one per organization. This file contains details of the Peer's endpoint url to connect clients to. Older Fabric Client SDKs would need all the information in this file, but the new "Gateway SDKs" remove the need for all the detail. The new Gateway SDKs just need the peer's endpoint and TLS configuration. See this [example code](../../applications/ping-chaincode/src/fabric-connection-profile.ts) on how to parse this file easily for the Gateway SDK.

Third is the `_wallets` directory - there are three subdirectories, one each for the Ordering Organization, Organization 1, and Organization 2. These directories contain `*.id` files that contain details of identities and their respective credentials, similar to the MSP content, but in a JSON format that applications can more easily parse:

```
_wallets
├── Orderer
│   └── ordereradmin.id
├── org1
│   ├── org1admin.id
│   └── org1caadmin.id
└── org2
    ├── org2admin.id
    └── org2caadmin.id
```

`org1admin.id` contains the credentials for submitting transactions from an org1 admin.
`org1caadmin.id` contains the credentials for creating additional identities in the org1 Certificate Authority (CA).

Note that when MicroFab started it automatically launched a Certificate Authority that created these identities and their respective credentials.

Pick one of the id files and look at the JSON content including the public certificate and private key:

```bash
cat _cfg/uf/_wallets/org1/org1admin.id | jq
```

You'll see the contents of org1admin.id:

```bash
{
  "credentials": {
    "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n  xxxx \n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
    "privateKey": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n  xxxx  \n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
  },
  "mspId": "org1MSP",
  "type": "X.509",
  "version": 1
}
```

This information then can be used by the client applications. See [this example code](../../applications/ping-chaincode/src/jsonid-adapter.ts) for how you can directly parse this file to use with the gateway.

At this point you may wish to run `docker logs -f microfab` in a separate window to watch the activity - you don't need to setup anything specific here.

## Package and deploy chaincode to Fabric

We are going to use the Chaincode-As-A-Service (CCAAS) pattern for chaincode.
With the CCAAS pattern, the Fabric peer does not launch a deployed chaincode.
Instead, we will run chaincode as an external process so that we can easily start, stop, update, and debug the chaincode locally.
But we still need to tell the peer where the chaincode is running. We do this by deploying a chaincode package that only includes the name of the chaincode and chaincode address, rather than the actual chaincode source code.

### Package and deploy chaincode using `just` recipe.

```bash
just debugcc
```

You will see the chaincode id and deployment steps returned.

### Details of this packaging and deployment

If you would like to understand chaincode packaging and deployment process in more detail you can walk through the steps manually here. Otherwise you can [skip ahead to the next section to run the chaincode](#run-the-chaincode-locally).

Fabric chaincode packages are a `tgz` format archive that contain two files:

- `metadata.json` - the chaincode label and type
- `code.tar.gz` - source artifacts for the chaincode

Create the `metadata.json` first, this tells the Peer the type of chaincode and a label to use to refer to this later

```bash
cat << METADATAJSON-EOF > metadata.json
{
    "type": "ccaas",
    "label": "asset-transfer"
}
METADATAJSON-EOF
```

Create the `code.tar.gz` - for the Chaincode-as-a-service, this file will contain a single JSON file `connection.json`. Traditional Fabric packaging would include all the source code of the chaincode here. In this case, we need the JSON file to contain the URL the peer will find the chaincode at and a timeout. Note this is a special hostname so the peer inside the docker container can locate the chaincode running on the host system

```
cat << CONNECTIONJSON-EOF > connection.json
{
  "address":"host.docker.internal:9999",
  "dial_timeout":"15s"
}
CONNECTIONJSON-EOF
```

We can now build the actual package. Create a code.tar.gz archive containing the connection.json file.

```bash
tar -czf code.tar.gz connection.json
```

Create the final chaincode package archive.

```bash
tar -czf asset-transfer.tgz metadata.json code.tar.gz
```

We're going to use the peer CLI commands to install and deploy the chaincode. Chaincode is 'deployed' by indicating agreement to it and then committing it to a channel:

```
source _cfg/uf/org1admin.env

peer lifecycle chaincode install asset-transfer.tgz
```

The ChaincodeID that is returned from this install command needs to be saved, typically this is best as an environment variable

```bash
export CHAINCODE_ID=$(peer lifecycle chaincode calculatepackageid asset-transfer.tgz)
```

Next, define the chaincode on the blockchain channel by approving it and committing it. If you have already deployed the chaincode using the `just` recipe above, then increment the `--sequence` number to `2`.

```bash
peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg --channelID mychannel --name asset-transfer -v 0 --package-id $CHAINCODE_ID --sequence 2 --connTimeout 15s
peer lifecycle chaincode commit --channelID mychannel --name asset-transfer -v 0 --sequence 2 --connTimeout 15s
```

## Run the chaincode locally

We'll use the example typescript contract already written in `$WORKSHOP_PATH/contracts/asset-transfer-typescript`. Feel free to take a look at the contract code in [contracts/asset-transfer-typescript/src/assetTransfer.ts](../../contracts/asset-transfer-typescript/src/assetTransfer.ts). You'll see the implementation of contract functions such as `CreateAsset()` and `ReadAsset()` there.

Use another terminal window for the chaincode. Make sure the terminal is setup with the same environment variables as the first terminal:

```
cd fabric-samples/full-stack-asset-transfer-guide
export WORKSHOP_PATH=$(pwd)
export PATH=${WORKSHOP_PATH}/bin:$PATH
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=${WORKSHOP_PATH}/config
```

As with any typescript module we need to run `npm install` to manage the dependencies for the chaincode and then build (compile) the chaincode typescript to javascript.

```
cd contracts/asset-transfer-typescript

npm install

npm run build
```

An easy way to test the contract has been built ok, is to generate the 'Contract Metadata' into a `metadata.json` file. This is a language agnostic definition of the contracts, and the datatypes the contract returns. It borrows from the OpenAPI used for defining REST APIs. It is also very useful to share to teams writing client applications so they know the data structures and transaction functions they can call.
As it's a JSON document, it's amenable to process to create other resources.

The metadata-generate command has been put into the `package.json`:

```
npm run metadata
```

Review the generated `metadata.json` and see the summary of the contract information, the transaction functions, and datatypes. This information can also be captured at runtime and is a good way of testing deployment.

## Iterative Development and Test

**All the steps up until here are one time only. You can now iterate over the development of your contract**

From your chaincode terminal window lets start the Smart Contract node module. Remember that the `CHAINCODE_ID` and the `CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS` are the only pieces of information needed.

Note: Use your specific CHAINCODE_ID from earlier; the `CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS` is different - this is because in this case it is telling the chaincode where to listen for incoming connections from the Peer. We'll use port 9999 on the local machine.

```
source ${WORKSHOP_PATH}/_cfg/uf/org1admin.env

# if you ran the justfile above, these will already be exported, but you may want to double check they are set:
export CHAINCODE_SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:9999
export CHAINCODE_ID=$(peer lifecycle chaincode calculatepackageid asset-transfer.tgz)

npm run start:server-debug
```

### Run some transactions

Choose a terminal window to run the transactions from; initially we'll use the `peer` CLI to run the commands.

If this is a new terminal window set the environment variables:

```
cd fabric-samples/full-stack-asset-transfer-guide
export WORKSHOP_PATH=$(pwd)
export PATH=${WORKSHOP_PATH}/bin:$PATH
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=${WORKSHOP_PATH}/config
```

Make sure that the peer binary and the config directory are set (run the `${WORKSHOP_PATH}/check.sh` script to double check).

Set up the environment context for acting as the Org 1 Administrator.

```
source ${WORKSHOP_PATH}/_cfg/uf/org1admin.env
```

Use the peer CLI to issue basic query commands against the contract. For example check the metadata for the contract (if you have jq, it's easier to read if you pipe the results into jq). Use one of these commands:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-transfer -c '{"Args":["org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata"]}'
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-transfer -c '{"Args":["org.hyperledger.fabric:GetMetadata"]}' | jq
```

Let's create an asset with ID=001:

```
peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -o orderer-api.127-0-0-1.nip.io:8080 -n asset-transfer -c '{"Args":["CreateAsset","{\"ID\":\"001\", \"Color\":\"Red\",\"Size\":52,\"Owner\":\"Fred\",\"AppraisedValue\":234234}"]}' --connTimeout 15s
```

If you are watching the MicroFab logs you'll see that the peer committed a new block to the ledger.

Now read back that asset:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-transfer -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","001"]}'
```

You'll see the asset returned:

```
{"AppraisedValue":234234,"Color":"Red","ID":"001","Owner":"{\"org\":\"org1MSP\",\"user\":\"Fred\"}","Size":52}
```

### Making a change and re-running the code

If we invoke a query command on a asset that does not exist, for example 002, we'll get back an error:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-transfer -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","002"]}'
```

returns error:

```
Error: endorsement failure during query. response: status:500 message:"Sorry, asset 002 has not been created"
```

Let's say we want to change that error message to something else.

- Stop the running chaincode (CTRL-C in the chaincode terminal)
- Load the `src/assetTransfer.ts` file into an editor of your choice
- Around line 51, find the error string and make a modification. Remember to save the change.
- Rebuild the typescript contract:

```
npm run build
```

You can now restart the contract as before

```
npm run start:server-debug
```

And run the same query, and see the updated error message:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n asset-transfer -c '{"Args":["ReadAsset","002"]}'
```

## Debugging

As the chaincode was started with the Node.js debug setting, you can connect a node.js debugger. For example VSCode has a good typescript/node.js debugger.

If you select the debug tab, and open the debug configurations, add "Attach to a node.js process" configuration.
VSCode will prompt you with the template. The default port should be sufficient here.
You can then start the 'attached to process' debug, and pick the process to debug into.

Remember to set a breakpoint at the start of the transaction function you want to debug.

Watch out for:

- VSCode uses node, so take care in selecting the right process
- remember the client/fabric transaction timeout, whilst you have the chaincode stopped in the debugger, the timeout is still 'ticking'

Look at the [Test and Debugging Contracts](./03-Test-And-Debug-Reference.md) for more details and information on other languages.
