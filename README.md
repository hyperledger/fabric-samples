# Hyperledger Fabric Samples

You can use Fabric samples to get started working with Hyperledger Fabric, explore important Fabric features, and learn how to build applications that can interact with blockchain networks using the Fabric SDKs. To learn more about Hyperledger Fabric, visit the [Fabric documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2).

Note that this branch contains samples for the Fabric v2.2 release. For the latest Fabric version, refer to the [main](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples) branch.

## Getting started with the Fabric samples

To use the Fabric samples, you need to download the Fabric Docker images and the Fabric CLI tools. First, make sure that you have installed all of the [Fabric prerequisites](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/prereqs.html). You can then follow the instructions to [Install the Fabric Samples, Binaries, and Docker Images](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/install.html) in the Fabric documentation. In addition to downloading the Fabric images and tool binaries, the Fabric samples will also be cloned to your local machine.

## Test network

The [Fabric test network](test-network) in the samples repository provides a Docker Compose based test network with two
Organization peers and an ordering service node. You can use it on your local machine to run the samples listed below.
You can also use it to deploy and test your own Fabric chaincodes and applications. To get started, see
the [test network tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/test_network.html).

## Asset transfer samples and tutorials

The asset transfer series provides a series of sample smart contracts and applications to demonstrate how to store and transfer assets using Hyperledger Fabric.
Each sample and associated tutorial in the series demonstrates a different core capability in Hyperledger Fabric. The **Basic** sample provides an introduction on how
to write smart contracts and how to interact with a Fabric network using the Fabric SDKs. The **Ledger queries**, **Private data**, and **State-based endorsement**
samples demonstrate these additional capabilities. Finally, the **Secured agreement** sample demonstrates how to bring all the capabilities together to securely
transfer an asset in a more realistic transfer scenario.
